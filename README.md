# BankBoost

Managing finances is an important aspect of daily life, involving informed decision-making
about financial products like banking rates. However, the financial industry in Sri Lanka is
experiencing significant growth, leading to a wide array of options for consumers. This
abundance of choices makes it challenging for consumers to stay updated on the latest rates
and deals. To overcome this, an application is proposed to provide a convenient solution. The
application will offer comprehensive information on banking rates in Sri Lanka, along with the
locations of these banks throughout the country. This will enhance accessibility and reduce the
time and effort required for users to gather information.
